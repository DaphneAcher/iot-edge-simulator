Introduction
The proliferation of IoT devices has created significant challenges in network bandwidth utilization and cloud infrastructure costs. Traditional cloud-centric architectures require continuous data transmission from edge devices to centralized servers, resulting in inefficient use of network resources [1]. Edge computing addresses this by performing data processing and filtering at the network edge, transmitting only relevant information to cloud services [2].
This simulator demonstrates the bandwidth savings achievable through edge computing by implementing threshold-based filtering, anomaly detection, and event-driven transmission protocols across multiple IoT use cases.
Problem Statement
IoT sensors generate continuous data streams, with typical sensor networks producing readings at frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz [3]. In cloud-only architectures, every sensor reading requires network transmission, consuming bandwidth proportional to the reading frequency multiplied by the number of sensors. For large-scale deployments with thousands of sensors, this approach becomes prohibitively expensive and can saturate available network capacity.
Proposed Solution
Edge computing introduces an intermediate processing layer between IoT sensors and cloud infrastructure. This layer implements intelligent filtering algorithms that reduce data transmission by 80-95% while preserving critical information [4]. The simulator models this architecture using:

Threshold-based filtering (transmit only when values change significantly)
Anomaly detection (identify unusual patterns requiring immediate attention)
Event-driven transmission (critical events always trigger transmission)
Multi-sensor correlation (make decisions based on multiple data sources)

## Simulation Scenarios

### 1. Smart Traffic Management

Monitors urban traffic conditions using multiple sensor types to detect congestion and incidents.

**Sensors**:
- Vehicle count (threshold: 3 vehicles)
- Average speed (threshold: 10 mph)
- Pedestrian count (threshold: 5 people)

**Critical Events**:
- Traffic jam (probability: 3%)
- Accident (probability: 1%)

**Application**: Intelligent transportation systems use edge computing to reduce latency in traffic signal control while minimizing bandwidth to central management systems [6].

### 2. Industrial Machine Monitoring

Implements predictive maintenance through continuous equipment health monitoring.

**Sensors**:
- Vibration frequency (threshold: 15 Hz)
- Hydraulic pressure (threshold: 25 PSI)
- Operating temperature (threshold: 20 degrees C)

**Critical Events**:
- Bearing failure (probability: 2%)

- Soil pH (threshold: 0.5)
- Nitrogen content (threshold: 8 ppm)

**Critical Events**:

## Methodology

### Simulation Algorithm

The core simulation engine executes the following algorithm at each time step:
```
For each time interval t:
    1. Generate sensor readings with random fluctuation
    2. Check for critical event occurrence
    3. Apply event effects to sensor data if applicable
    4. Cloud-only approach: increment packet counter
    5. Edge computing approach:
        a. Calculate delta for each sensor: |current - last_sent|
        b. Check if any delta >= threshold
        c. Perform anomaly detection (rate of change analysis)
        d. If (threshold_exceeded OR anomaly OR critical_event):
            - Increment edge packet counter
            - Update last_sent values
    6. Update visualization data every 10 intervals
```

### Filtering Strategies

#### Threshold-Based Filtering

Transmits data only when sensor values deviate from the last transmitted value by more than a predefined threshold. This implements the principle of "exception reporting" common in industrial control systems [10].

Mathematical formulation:
```
transmit = |x(t) - x(t_last)| >= θ
where:
  x(t) = current sensor value
  x(t_last) = last transmitted value
  θ = threshold parameter
```

#### Anomaly Detection

Monitors the rate of change in sensor values to identify anomalous behavior patterns. Implements a simplified version of statistical process control [11].
```
anomaly = |x(t) - x(t-1)| > 0.5 * θ
Event-Driven Transmission
Critical events always trigger immediate transmission regardless of threshold status, implementing priority-based communication protocols [12].
Performance Metrics
The simulator calculates the following metrics:

Bandwidth Reduction: (1 - edge_packets / cloud_packets) * 100%
Total Packets Saved: cloud_packets - edge_packets
Data Volume Reduction: (cloud_packets - edge_packets) * packet_size

Packet size is modeled as 0.15 KB based on typical IoT telemetry payload sizes [13].
Results
Expected Performance
Based on the simulation parameters and filtering algorithms, typical results show:

Traffic Management: 82-88% bandwidth reduction
Industrial Monitoring: 85-92% bandwidth reduction
Agriculture: 88-94% bandwidth reduction
Security Systems: 90-96% bandwidth reduction

Higher reduction percentages in security and agriculture scenarios result from less frequent threshold violations and sparser event occurrence compared to continuously variable systems like traffic and industrial equipment.
Factors Affecting Performance

Threshold Selection: Lower thresholds increase data transmission frequency
Sensor Variability: Higher natural fluctuation reduces filtering effectiveness
Event Probability: More frequent critical events increase transmission requirements
Anomaly Detection: Enabling anomaly detection increases sensitivity to unusual patterns
